# OPENCV
(OpenCV is Open Computer Vision Library [4]. It was initially  launched  in  1999  by  Intel. 
     With  more updates, it has been modified since then to aim for the real-time  computer  vision. 
      This  library  has  been written under programming languages like C and C+.
       It  can be easily  run on  operating systems Windows and Linux. This  library can  be easily 
       interface with programing languages like Python, MATLAB, Ruby and others as well. 
       Along with Numpy [6] and Python image  processing  (shape  & color  detection) can  be performed at ease)
